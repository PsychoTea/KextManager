#KextManager Server
An open source, PHP server that KextManager communicates with and grabs kexts and their information from.

# THIS PROGRAM IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND DOES NOT WORK JUST YET!

##Why is the server open source?
Because I want people to be able to host their own kext servers, so KextManager doesn't have to depend on a single hub.

##Can I improve your nasty code?
Yes, help me out brotha!

##How do I use this?
1. Place it on a server with PHP installed.
2. Change the kext server configurations to your server info in KextManager.py
3. Profit?
